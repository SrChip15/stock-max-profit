# Stock Max Profit

## Description
This is a library that allows one to calculate the max possible profit from an array of time ordered stock prices.

## Use
* Firstly import the module -->
```javascript
let maxSpread = require('./maxSpread');
```
* And now simply pass the array with the data to the `maxSpread()` function you imported from the module.
* Implemented as an anonymous function to preserve simplicity.
